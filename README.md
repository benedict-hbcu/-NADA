# -NADA
Not Another Dating App, is a dating website developed to tackle the unconventional ways of online dating.

NADA is a dating app designed to create organic connections through conversations rather than based on a persons image. 

Having seen and heard about persons experience on different websites, we wanted to do something different, where individuals can create meaningful connections. Thinking about it, we could have swiped left on an individual with a great personality, if we are "judging a book by its cover". 

Instead we want you to get to know the person first, and make decisions not based solely on a portrayal of who they are, based on an image.

The contributors to this project are Ashanique Moore and Dachanelle Anderson.
